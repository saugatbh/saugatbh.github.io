I'm Dr. Saugat Bhattacharyya, a Lecturer in Computer Science at the School of Computing, Engineering & Intelligent Systems. My research revolves around Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), Neurotechnology, AI, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning, particularly in their applications to Human-Machine Interaction and Neuro-Rehabilitation. I focus on developing advanced BCI systems that use sophisticated signal processing and machine learning algorithms to interpret a user's mental state through their brain and physiological signals.

I've published over 60 papers in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences, and I've been lucky enough to be involved in several exciting research projects, like the US-Ireland R&D Partnership Programme and the MRC Equipment Grant. Iâ€™ve also received PhD fellowships from CSIR, India, and Erasmus Mundus. Currently, I serve as treasurer for the IEEE-EMBS UK-Ireland chapter and as an associate editor for Frontiers in Medical Technology and MDPI Brain Sciences.
